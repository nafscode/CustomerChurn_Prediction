# CustomerChurn_Prediction

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period -- say a quarter -- by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate.
Every bank wants to hold their customers as a means of sustaining their business.
